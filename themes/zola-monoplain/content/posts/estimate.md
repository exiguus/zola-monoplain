## Summary

Estimation in software development is essential for planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and managing progress. However, refinement must precede estimation to understand the work fully. Refinement involves breaking down tasks, defining scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, risks, assumptions, and constraints. Techniques like spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes help reduce risks. Refinement ensures accurate estimations, facilitating successful delivery within time, budget, scope, and quality.

## Introduction

Sometimes people think that estimation is not possible.

And because of that not necessary. But estimation is possible. And necessary. But before you estimate, you need to refine the work.
Regardless of the methodology you use.

This article takes a closer look at the importance of refinement before estimation in software development. And how spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes can help reduce risks and uncertainties.

This works for teams that use Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean, or any other methodology as well as for your personal projects.

## TL;DR

If you think estimation is not possible, do timeboxed research and based on the results, estimate the work.

## Why do you Estimate?

Because you need to plan your work. Simple as that, when you work with others.

- You estimate to plan the work.
- You estimate to schedule the work.
- You estimate to allocate the resources.
- You estimate to manage the expectations.
- You estimate to communicate the progress.
- You estimate to track the progress.
- You estimate to report the progress.
- You estimate to make decisions.
- You estimate to make commitments.
- You estimate to deliver value.
- You estimate to deliver quality.
- You estimate to deliver on time.
- You estimate to deliver on budget.
- You estimate to deliver on scope.
- You estimate to deliver on quality.
- You estimate to deliver on expectations.
- You estimate to deliver on commitments.

Shared expectations (and communication) is the key to success, when you work with others.

As a team, you estimate to plan the work and deliver value for the stakeholders and the customers in the current sprint or iteration.

Being in time, budget, scope, quality and expectations builds trust with the stakeholders and the customers.

## Before you Estimate

Before you estimate, you need something to estimate:
A User Story, Business Requirements, a Ticket, Task.

You need to understand what you are estimating.
There for you need to break down the work into smaller pieces.

- You need to define the scope of the work.
- You need to define the acceptance criteria.
- You need to define the dependencies and risks.
- You need to define the assumptions and constraints.

In other words, you need to refine the work.
To Refine the work, you have to understand the work.

If you don't understand the work, you can't estimate the work.
If you want to understand the work, you have to ask questions.

- You have to talk to the stakeholders.
- You have to do research.
- You have to do a spike.
- You have to do a proof of concept.
- You have to do a prototype.

Or, just do a refinement session.

## What is Refinement?

A way to understand the work.

- Refinement is a process.
- Refinement is a practice.
- Refinement is a technique.
- Refinement is a skill.
- Refinement is a mindset.
- Refinement is a culture.

As a team, you are able to understand the work.

## Why do you Refine?

Because you need to understand the work before you estimate the work.
In general, build things right before you build the right things.

- You refine to understand the work.
- You refine to break down the work.
- You refine to define the scope.
- You refine to define the acceptance criteria.
- You refine to define the dependencies.
- You refine to define the risks.
- You refine to define the assumptions.
- You refine to define the constraints.

Refinement enables estimation.

As a team, you are able to break down the work into smaller pieces and gain a shared understanding of the work. All team members, include the stakeholders, have the same understanding of the work. All have the same expectations.

## How do you Refine?

By looking at the work. The context. The requirements. The constraints. The dependencies. The risks. The assumptions.

- You refine by asking questions.
- You refine by talking to the stakeholders.
- You refine by doing research.
- You refine by doing a spike.
- You refine by doing a proof of concept.
- You refine by doing a prototype.

As a team, you are able to break down the work into smaller pieces.
Breaking down the work is a collaborative effort. Often quite challenging.
Doing spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes are ways to reduce the risk.

## Spikes, Proof of Concepts, Prototypes

Spikes, Proof of Concepts, and Prototypes are techniques used in software development to reduce uncertainty, validate ideas, and refine designs. While they share some similarities, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

All three techniques are timeboxed activities that help teams explore and address specific challenges or questions. By using these techniques, teams can gather information, test assumptions, and validate concepts before committing to full-scale development and implementation.

Regardless of the methodology you use, spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes can help you manage risks, make informed decisions, and deliver successful projects.

While refining the work, you can use spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes to reduce the risk and gain a shared understanding and knowledge of the work.

A spike is a timeboxed research activity.

A proof of concept is a timeboxed learning activity.

A prototype is a timeboxed experiment.

All three techniques help you to reduce the risk.

- The risk of not understanding the work.
- The risk of not estimating the work.
- The risk of not delivering the work.
- The risk of not delivering value.
- The risk of not delivering quality.
- The risk of not delivering on time.
- The risk of not delivering on budget.
- The risk of not delivering on scope.
- The risk of not delivering on quality.
- The risk of not delivering on expectations.
- The risk of not delivering on commitments.

As a team, you are able to do spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes as research and learning activities.

### Spikes

- **Purpose**: To investigate and reduce uncertainty around a specific issue or question.
- **Focus**: Gathering information and understanding technical or functional challenges.
- **Timeboxed**: Yes, typically a short duration.
- **Outcome**: Knowledge gained, risks identified, and clearer path forward.
- **Example**: Researching a new framework to determine its suitability for the project.

### Proof of Concepts (PoC)

- **Purpose**: To validate the feasibility of an idea or approach.
- **Focus**: Demonstrating that a concept or theory is viable.
- **Timeboxed**: Yes, but can vary depending on complexity.
- **Outcome**: Confirmation that an approach can work (or not) in a real-world scenario.
- **Example**: Creating a simple implementation to confirm that a new API can interact with an existing system.

### Prototypes

- **Purpose**: To create a working model of a part or whole of a system to explore design and functionality.
- **Focus**: Building a preliminary version to test design choices and usability.
- **Timeboxed**: Yes, with enough time to build and test the prototype.
- **Outcome**: Visual and functional feedback on design, interface, and user experience.
- **Example**: Developing a prototype of a new user interface to gather user feedback before full-scale development.

| **Outcome**          | Knowledge and risk identification  | Confirmation or rejection of an approach | Feedback on design and usability          |
| **Typical Duration** | Short (hours to a few days)        | Varies (short to moderate duration)      | Varies (short to moderate duration)       |
| **Example**          | Research a new framework           | Simple implementation to test a new API  | Early version of a user interface         |

### Use Cases

- **Spikes**: When your team encounters unknowns or risks that need exploration before proceeding with development.
- **Proof of Concepts**: When your team needs to prove that a particular approach or technology will work as intended.
- **Prototypes**: When your team needs to visualize and test aspects of design and functionality to gather feedback and refine the final product.

As a team, you are able to use spikes, proof of concepts, and prototypes to reduce risks and uncertainties, validate ideas, and refine designs.

All three techniques are timeboxed activities that help teams explore and address specific challenges or questions. By using these techniques, teams can gather information, test assumptions, and validate concepts before committing to full-scale development and implementation.
